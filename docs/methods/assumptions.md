# Assumptions and diagnostics

## Common-grid FPCA

The core FPCA assumes complete functional observations on a common monotone grid after explicit preprocessing.

Check unresolved missing values, comparability of time domains, influential curves, and stability under defensible preprocessing choices.

## MFPCA scaling

Different dimensions can have different integrated variance. Compare `scaling="none"` and `scaling="dimension_sd"` when the scale choice is scientifically uncertain.

## Registration

Inspect warping functions. Extreme warpings can indicate that curves do not share a meaningful common template.

## Downstream modeling

FPCA scores are estimated features. Standard downstream errors generally do not propagate uncertainty in the estimated functional basis.
