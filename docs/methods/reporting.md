# Reporting checklist

Report enough information to reconstruct the functional estimand.

## Representation
- trajectory unit;
- coordinate system and units;
- time origin, units, and window;
- whether curves share stimulus geometry;
- functional dimensions.

## Preprocessing
- common-grid construction;
- interpolation method and maximum bridged gap;
- remaining missingness/exclusion rule;
- smoothing method/parameters, if used;
- coordinate normalization or landmark centering;
- time normalization, if used.

## FPCA/MFPCA
- estimator/backend;
- grid/quadrature treatment;
- channel scaling;
- component-retention rule;
- variance explained;
- component interpretation procedure.

## Registration
- whether registration was performed;
- landmark definition or elastic backend;
- rotation/scale invariance;
- how phase/warpings were retained.

## Multilevel analysis
- nesting structure;
- participant/trial decomposition;
- retained components at each level.

## Compositional analysis
- probability construction;
- log-ratio reference dimension;
- zero replacement epsilon;
- inverse-transform interpretation.
