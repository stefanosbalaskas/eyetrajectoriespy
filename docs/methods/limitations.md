# Limitations and failure modes

## Not a replacement for event analysis

Whole-trajectory analysis does not make fixations, saccades, dwell, or AOI transitions obsolete.

## Sampling rate still matters

A functional curve cannot recover dynamics that were never sampled.

## Smoothing can invent motion

Over-smoothing can turn abrupt transitions and missing gaps into visually convincing but fictitious movement.

## Registration can erase the effect

If treatment changes inspection latency, registration may align away the effect of interest.

## Layout confounding

FPCA can discover stimulus geometry rather than participant strategy when layouts are pooled without defensible harmonization.

## Components are sample-dependent

FPCs are empirical modes of variation. Replication or stability analysis may be needed before strong substantive labeling.

## Current multilevel implementation

The first release uses a two-level decomposition followed by separate FPCAs, not a full Bayesian or likelihood-based functional mixed model.


## Bootstrap stability is not inferential certainty

A high matched-component similarity shows that a component shape is reproducible under the chosen resampling scheme. It does not establish construct validity, causality, or generalization to another task/stimulus population.

## Irregular projection can change the estimand

Restricting to the common overlap shortens the time window. Using the union preserves the wider window but creates edge missingness. Neither choice is neutral.

## Phase decomposition depends on registration

Phase FPCA describes the estimated warping functions from a specific registration procedure. Different landmarks or elastic penalties can produce different phase representations.

## Basis interoperability is optional

The package preserves provenance around basis projection but delegates the basis mathematics to scikit-fda. Backend-version differences should be recorded in reproducible analyses.
