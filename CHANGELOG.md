## 0.2.0.dev0 — 2026-09-18

Second development tranche.

- native `IrregularTrajectorySet` objects preserve curve-specific sampling without forced interpolation;
- explicit overlap/union common-grid construction and gap-protected irregular-to-grid projection;
- bootstrap FPCA component stability with curve- or participant-level resampling and deterministic seeds;
- matched functional-component similarity and reconstruction diagnostics;
- phase functions and phase FPCA from registration warpings;
- registered-versus-unregistered FPCA sensitivity diagnostics;
- provenance-preserving optional B-spline/Fourier projection through scikit-fda;
- expanded examples for irregular data, stability, phase analysis, and basis interoperability;
- tutorial gallery, pre-registration checklist, and expanded methods/site navigation;
- optional FDA interoperability CI.
